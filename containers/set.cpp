/*
NOTES:Set is a red black tree which is a bst of logn height(self balancing bst)
1))
STL provides the special container for it – set. Set can add, remove
and check the presence of particular element in O(log N), where N is
the count of objects in the set. While adding elements to set, the
duples [duplicates?] are discarded. A count of the elements in the set,
N, is returned in O(1).
2))The push_back() member may not be used with set. It make sense:
since the order of elements in set does not matter, push_back() is not
applicable here.
3))Since set is not a linear container, it’s impossible to take the
element in set by index. Therefore, the only way to traverse the
elements of set is to use iterators.
